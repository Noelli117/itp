What will (likely) be the title of your project?
"FM synthesiszer made in python"

In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")
My project is about creating a Frequency modulation synthesiszer in python.

In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
By utlizing audio programming libries python has and also numpy to achieve creating a FM synth by building around the FM formula: 
"f(t)=sin(2pi*(f_c*t+m*sin(2pi*f_m*t)))"
f(t)=is the instantaneous frequency of the carrier wave at time "t"
f_c=carrier frequency
m=modulation index (the ratio of frequency deviation to the modulating frequency.)
f_m=modulation frequency

If you are planning to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
I wanna combine knowledges I learnt in the intro to sound design class, which is how to use a FM synth also how to create one.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I will know how to audio programme by using libries in python, and also the princple of FM synthesising.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A basic FM synth that can produce sound.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A usable FM synth that could produce sound.

In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
1.Try to install all the libries I need for the project (e.g. numpy and sounddevice...)
2.Try to understand how FM formula works and try to convert it to codes.
