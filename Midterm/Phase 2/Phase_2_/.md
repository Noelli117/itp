The codes down below is what I got for Phase 2, which was not a big challenge except for the degree to radian calculation which I searched it out online.

def setup():
    size(1000, 1000)
    noStroke() #I did not know this thing when first wrote these codes, so I searched it up and figured out that it means not to draw outlines around shapes.

def draw():
    fill(0)
    ellipse(250,250,70,70)
    ellipse(750,250,70,70)
    arc(500,600,70,70,radians(0),radians(180))
